This is the data and analysis system for the article published in Frontiers in Computer Science, by R. Paisa, N. C. Nilsson and S. Serfain.

The analysis and plots are generated using R - the "Analysis.R" file in the "Analysis" folder should be self sufficient, as long as the libraries required are installed, and the path is set correctly to point to the "Paper logs and Table.xlsx" file*. This file is also found in the "Analysis" folder. 

*The only up-to-date tab is the "Table of Devices For Analysis" and "Table of Devices For Latex"
